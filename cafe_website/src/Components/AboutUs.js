          <p>
            Welcome to Sip & Play, where board games, boba, and delicious food collide in a symphony of fun! Our founder, Jonathan Li, couldn't choose between his love for board games and his craving for boba, so he decided to mix them up into Park Slopeâ€™s first board game cafe.
          </p>
